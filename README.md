This project addresses the network design needs of a trading floor support center undergoing a relocation to a new, three-story building. The existing workforce of 600 staff, distributed across six departments, demands a robust and secure network solution capable of supporting current and future needs.
This document outlines the design and implementation of a logical network for the new facility. The primary focus is on creating a scalable and redundant network infrastructure that prioritizes security and efficient resource allocation. The design incorporates industry best practices and utilizes Cisco Packet Tracer software for visualization and configuration.
