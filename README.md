This project addresses the network design needs of a trading floor support center undergoing a relocation to a new, three-story building. The existing workforce of 600 staff, distributed across six departments, demands a robust and secure network solution capable of supporting current and future needs.

This repository contains the Cisco Packet Tracer file (.pkt) for the logical network design of a trading floor support center relocating to a new three-story building.

Project Overview
The network caters to 600 staff across six departments:

Sales & Marketing
HR & Logistics
Finance & Accounts
Administration & PR
ICT
Server Room
The design prioritizes:

Scalability for future growth
Security through departmental VLANs and access control
Redundancy for high availability
Requirements
Software: Cisco Packet Tracer (version compatible with this file)
Note: This repository only contains the Cisco Packet Tracer file. The physical network implementation details (routers, switches, cabling) will depend on the specific vendor chosen and the final network layout of the building.
